# Petrable

**An open-source iOS and macOS app that builds apps.

![Petrable showcase video —54s with narration](docs/petrable-showcase.mp4)
** Type a prompt → a free AI model writes the code →
it goes live in the cloud → you preview it right inside the app. Web apps run in
[Daytona](https://daytona.io) sandboxes; native iOS apps are compiled by
[Chorus](https://ios.chorus.com) cloud Xcode and previewed in a browser iPhone simulator — or
installed on your real phone via an OTA link the agent drops in chat.

Made by **[KAF World Digital](https://kafworlddigital.com)**.

Built with SwiftUI + [Convex](https://convex.dev) + a chain of free AI providers (Gemini, Groq, NVIDIA, GitHub Models, OpenRouter, Cerebras, Cloudflare, local Ollama). No auth, no waitlist — it's your
own stack, your own keys.

## The fastest way to set it up

Give this repo to [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (or any capable coding agent)
and say:

> Clone https://github.com/kafworlddigital/petrable and set it up for me.

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is written for the agent: it walks through creating the free Convex
backend, collecting each API key (with exact URLs), configuring the iOS app, building it, and
verifying an end-to-end build — asking you only for the keys.

Prefer to do it by hand? `AGENTS.md` reads just as well for humans.

Every model the backend uses is free — see [`FREE_PROVIDERS.md`](FREE_PROVIDERS.md)
for the live status board, key setup and troubleshooting.

## What it does

- **Web | Mobile toggle** — web prompts become polished static web apps served from a public
  Daytona sandbox; mobile prompts become real SwiftUI apps compiled in the cloud
- **Live agent chat** — build status streams in real time (Convex subscriptions); follow-up
  messages edit the app; compile errors on mobile builds are auto-repaired by the agent
- **In-app preview** — web apps render in a WKWebView; iOS apps stream from a cloud iPhone
  simulator, with reload / open-in-Safari / share
- **Install on your iPhone** — ask the chat for "the download link" and the agent signs the
  build (ad-hoc, via your Apple account connected to Chorus) and posts an OTA install link
- **Model picker** — per-project free model tier with 8 models (Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, Llama 3.1, Qwen 3.8, Nemotron 3.5, DeepSeek V3, GPT-OSS 120B, GPT-OSS 20B) and automatic fallback between free providers
- **Voice input** — mic in every composer, transcribed by free Groq Whisper (key stays server-side)
- **AI skill for generated apps** — a keyless proxy to the free model chain means every app
  the agent builds can have AI features without leaking any key into client code

## What's next

Planned upgrades:

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-app** — hold, talk, and Petrable builds while you walk away from the phone
- 🔔 **Build notifications** — close the app and get a push the moment your build is live
- 🚀 **One-tap publishing** — share live preview links, custom domains, and App Store submission straight from your phone

## Keys you'll need

Google Gemini, Groq, NVIDIA, GitHub Models, OpenRouter, Cerebras, Cloudflare or Ollama (free tiers — at least one required) · Daytona (web builds) ·
Groq (free voice transcription, optional). All keys live as Convex env vars on **your**
deployment — none are committed, and generated apps never contain them.

## Honest caveats

- The Convex functions are unauthenticated by design (single-user app) — anyone with your
  deployment URL could create builds on your accounts. A soft rate limit on new projects is
  included, but keep the URL to yourself or add auth for anything public.
- The `/ai/*` gateway proxy is public for the same reason; rotate your `vck_` key if needed.
- Web preview URLs are public links (that's what makes sharing work).
- The UI is a loving clone of Lovable's mobile app for personal use — if you ship this
  somewhere serious, re-skin it.

## Origin

Petrable is built on top of the open-source [Rilable](https://github.com/rbrown101010/rilable)
codebase (MIT). Rilable did the heavy lifting; KAF World Digital is shipping the polished fork
with the current free-provider chain and UI.

## Looking at alternatives?

Hosted tools like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) or [Replit](https://replit.com) will get you
running in a browser with no setup — and a monthly bill. Petrable is the open-source,
run-it-yourself, no-subscription option: your phone, your keys, your builds.
